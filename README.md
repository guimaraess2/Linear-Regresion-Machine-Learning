# Linear-Regresion-Machine-Learning
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
This analysis, applying artificial intelligence algorithm, more precisely machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression), based on a dataset from the Kaggle data repository, which consists of making a prediction of the life expectancy of people, in which the user types the year, and if you have the answer of how many years would be the life expectancy in that year. Python was used with the open-source web jupyter notebook tool, from the Anaconda distribution, which allows us to work with several libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Sckit learn for machine learning, and others.
